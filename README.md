# Design-Analyzer
A tool for analyzing models created using StarUML 2.0.
DA reads a .mdj file created by StarUML, then computes and prints the responsibility, instability, stability and deviance of every class in the model. DA assumes the model consists of a single class diagram together with the accompanying model elements (classes, associations, generalizations, packages, etc.).
